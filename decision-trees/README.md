Constructs and plots a simple decision tree to classify butterflies and birds. The input is a 2D dataset.

For each decision boundary, the following are provided:
1) level of the decision node
2) which axis is selected and the corresponding boundary value such as x=5.10. 
3) the following entropy values: 
    1) Eleft,  (or Etop)
    2) Eright (or Ebottom)
    3) their weighted average Etotal = wleftEleft + wrightEright.

The decision boundaries and the decision tree are compared with the ones obtained by scikit-learn (sklearn.tree.DecisionTreeClassifier).

The steps are repeated with another dataset generated by me.
